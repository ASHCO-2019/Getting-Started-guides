# <!SDK/API/COMPONENT NAME>

Many Creative Cloud app extensions require the ability to talk to API services on the web. With both Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) and Node.js at its core, CEP gives you the flexibility to make network calls from within your extension in the way that makes sense for your workflow.

![](<!IMAGE SRC URL HERE (optional image for UI components)>)

In this guide, we will cover how to call a third-party API service, update the panel UI according to the API response, and interact with the host app's creative asset based on the API response.

By the end of this guide, we will have a CEP extension that:

1. Calls the Dark Sky API to get the current weather for a particular city.
1. Displays a string in the panel UI that tells the user the current weather.
1. Lets the user click a button to dynamically alter the open asset based on the weather in Photoshop or InDesign.


## GitHub

You can find a companion GitHub repo for this developer guide [on GitHub](<!LINK HERE>).

Be sure to follow all instructions in the `readme`.


## Technology Used

- Supported Host Applications: Photoshop, InDesign
- Libraries/Frameworks/APIs:
    - Adobe-specific: [CEP](), ExtendScript for Photoshop and InDesign
    - Other: [Fetch](), [Dark Sky API]()


## Prerequisites

This guide will assume that you have installed all software and completed all steps in the following guides:

- [Getting Started](<!LINK HERE>)
- [Another Guide](<!LINK HERE>)


## Configuration

### Setting up the sample extension

There are two versions of this guide's companion sample extension:

- `./com.cep.weather/`
- `./com.cep.weather-simple/`

This guide will focus on `./com.cep.weather-simple/`, for the sake of focus; `./com.cep.weather/` offers slightly more robust functionality, and is a good starting point if you want to further explore the topics covered in this guide.

The following steps will help you get the sample extension for this guide up and running:

1. Install the `./com.cep.weather-simple/` directory in your extensions folder. <!(where is this?)>
1. Download and move CEP's `CSInterface.js` library to `./com.cep.weather-simple/client/js/lib/CSInterface.js`.
1. Get a free API Key from [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/dev).
1. Make a file named `config.js` at this path: `./com.cep.weather-simple/client/js/config.js`.
1. In your newly created `config.js` file, add this code, substituting in your Dark Sky API Key:

    ```
    const darkSkyKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
    ```

After following these steps, you'll be able to run the sample extension within the host apps indicated in the [Technology Used](#technology-used) section of this guide.


### Configuring `manifest.xml`

As noted in the [Getting Started guide](), the `manifest.xml` file is where, among other things, you indicate which Creative Cloud host apps and version numbers your extension supports.

For this guide, we'll make an extension that supports Photoshop and InDesign. So in the `manifest.xml`, make sure you list the supported host apps within the `<HostList>` element:

```xml
<!-- ...  -->
<ExecutionEnvironment>
  <HostList>
    <Host Name="PHSP" Version="19" /> <!-- Photoshop -->
    <Host Name="PHXS" Version="19" /> <!-- Photoshop -->
    <Host Name="IDSN" Version="13" /> <!-- InDesign -->
  </HostList>

  <!-- // ... -->
</ExecutionEnvironment>

<!-- // ... -->

```

Note that the versions indicted in the example code above only target a single version of each host app, for the sake of demo simplicity. Most extension developers will want to target a range of host app versions. To learn how to support ranges of host app versions, see the [CEP cookbook]().


## Setting up your UI

The user interface for CEP extensions is written in HTML. For this sample, the HTML document is located at `./com.cep.weather-simple/client/index.html` and contains the following code (see comments **#1-3**):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>Weather Simple</title>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <!-- 1) An empty paragraph element -->
	<p id="weather-summary"></p>

  <!-- 2) A button -->
	<button id="apply-weather-button">Apply weather</button>

  <!-- 3) Your scripts, including CEP's CSInterface.js library -->
	<script type="text/javascript" src="js/lib/CSInterface.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="js/config.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="js/index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

The document body in the code above contains two simple HTML elements: `button` and `p`, both uniquely identifiable by `id` attributes that we'll use in the steps below.

Note that, while this guide will not cover styling an extension with CSS, the CSS stylesheet for this sample panel can be found at `./com.cep.weather-simple/client/styles/style.css`.


## Setting up your service API interaction

As we saw in the `index.html` code in the previous section, the client-side JavaScript for this extension is located at `./com.cep.weather-simple/client/js/index.js`.

We will look at this `index.js` file in this section. We won't cover everything in the `index.js` file, but will give an overview, calling out a few important points along the way.


### Create references to the UI elements

Continuing on in `./com.cep.weather-simple/client/js/index.js`, we'll first reference the elements in our `index.html`:

```javascript
const applyWeatherButton = document.querySelector("#apply-weather-button");
const weatherSummary = document.querySelector("#weather-summary");
```

We'll work with these UI elements in the following steps.


### Request and display the weather for a particular city

Our extension will automatically get and display the weather for New York City when it loads.

![]()

In `index.js`, we have a `getWeather()` helper method that is immediately invoked. See comments **#1-8** in the code below:

```javascript
(function getWeather() {
  /* 1) Create an object to contain relevant city data */
  let cityObj = {name: "New York", lat: "40.40", lon: "-73.56"};

  /* 2) Set up the request URL for the Dark Sky API */
  let reqUrl = `https://api.darksky.net/forecast/${darkSkyKey}/${cityObj.lat},${cityObj.lon}`;

  /* 3) Make a request to the URL constructed above */
  fetch(reqUrl)
    .then(function(res) {
      /* 4) If the response is ok, return the Dark Sky JSON response */
      if (res.ok) return res.json();
    })
    .then(function(json) {
      /* 5) Get the current weather data from the Dark Sky JSON response */
      const currentWeatherSlug = json.currently.icon;

      /* 6) Display the weather information in the HTML DOM */
      const currentWeatherString = `It looks like it\'s ${weatherTypes[currentWeatherSlug]} in ${cityObj.name}.`;
      weatherSummary.textContent = currentWeatherString;

      /* 7) Add weather information to the button dataset for convenient access later */
      applyWeatherButton.dataset.currentWeatherSlug = currentWeatherSlug;
      applyWeatherButton.dataset.currentWeatherString = currentWeatherString;
    })
    .catch(function(err) {
      /* 8) Handle errors */
      weatherSummary.textContent = `We had trouble getting the weather for ${cityObj.name}. Please try again.`;
    });
})();
```

This method takes advantage of [the `fetch()` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch), provided by Chromium Embedded Framework in CEP, to make a network request. Note that the `fetch()` API returns a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise), which is why we follow up the request with `.then()/.catch()` syntax.


## Set up your Creative Cloud host app interaction

### Instantiate `CSInterface`

For any CEP panel, you'll need an instance of `CSInterface`, which, among other things, gives you access to the host app's scripting engine:

```javascript
const csInterface = new CSInterface();
```

We'll make use of this `csInterface` constant later on.


### Add a click handler to the button

We'll add a click handler to `applyWeatherButton`:

```javascript
applyWeatherButton.addEventListener("click", applyWeatherToAsset);
```

We'll make the `applyWeatherToAsset()` helper method in detail in the next step.


### Communicate with the host app

To communicate with the host app's scripting engine, we'll make use of the `csInterface.evalScript()` method. (If you need a refresher on the `.evalScript()` method, refer to the [Getting Started guide]().)

In this sample app, our `.evalScript()` call will be wrapped in a helper method called `applyWeatherToAsset()`, which we attached to our button's click handler in the step above. See comments **#1-3** in the code below:

```javascript
function applyWeatherToAsset(e) {
  /* 1) Get the dataset from the click event */
  const dataset = e.target.dataset;

  /* 2) Pass an ExtendScript function call to the host app with .evalScript() */
  csInterface.evalScript(`applyWeatherToAsset("${dataset.currentWeatherSlug}", "${dataset.currentWeatherString}")`);
}
```

We'll make the ExtendScript function in the next section.

## Automate the host app with ExtendScript

CC host apps like Photoshop and InDesign (and many more!) can be automated with ExtendScript. In this sample extension, we're going to alter the active asset in Photoshop or InDesign based on the weather.

Note once again that this sample app is extremely simple for the purpose of focus. ExtendScript provides many deep features to automate work in CC host apps; you can explore more ExtendScript features in our Scripting Guides.

The ExtendScript for this extension is located at `./com.cep.weather-simple/host/index.jsx`.


### Review the `.evalScript()` call

On the client-side, we finished up by making an `.evalScript()` call:

```javascript
csInterface.evalScript(`applyWeatherToAsset("${dataset.currentWeatherSlug}", "${dataset.currentWeatherString}")`);
```

We could interpret this code as meaning "Hey host app, call the `applyWeatherToAsset()` function from my ExtendScript file".

So we'll need to make sure that function exists.


### Create an ExtendScript function

In the extension's `index.jsx` file, let's create our function declaration:

```javascript
function applyWeatherToAsset(currentWeatherSlug, currentWeatherString) {

  // Code will go here

}
```

The function takes the `currentWeatherSlug` and `currentWeatherString` string arguments that we provided in the client-side `.evalScript()` call.


### Create element references based on the host app

Through ExtendScript, we can, among other things, interact with the host app's DOM to interact with elements in an open document. The available DOM properties and methods vary for each host app, so we'll make use of the global `app.name` property to determine which app the extension is running in (see comments **#1-4**):

```javascript
function applyWeatherToAsset(currentWeatherSlug, currentWeatherString) {
  var layer;
  var frame;

  /* 1) If we're running in Photoshop */
  if (app.name === "Adobe Photoshop") {

    /* 2) Make a reference to the first art layer of the first open document */
    layer = app.documents[0].artLayers[0];
  }
  /* 3) Otherwise, if we're running in InDesign */
  else if (app.name === "Adobe InDesign") {

    /* 4) Create a text frame on the first page of the first open document */
    frame = app.documents.item(0).pages.item(0).textFrames.add({geometricBounds: [72, 72, 110, 300]});
  }

  // To be continued...
}
```

So depending on the app the extension is running in, we'll either reference an art layer or create a text frame.


### Alter the open asset in the host app

As a final step, we'll alter the open asset depending on the weather. We'll make a `switch` statement to control what happens based on the `currentWeatherSlug` (see comments **1-8**):

```javascript
function applyWeatherToAsset(currentWeatherSlug, currentWeatherString) {
  var layer;
  var frame;

  if (app.name === "Adobe Photoshop") {
    layer = app.documents[0].artLayers[0];
  }
  else if (app.name === "Adobe InDesign") {
    frame = app.documents.item(0).pages.item(0).textFrames.add({geometricBounds: [72, 72, 110, 300]});
  }

  /* 1) Switch based on the currentWeatherSlug we got from the Dark Sky API */
  switch (currentWeatherSlug) {

    /* 2) If it's a clear day */
    case "clear-day":
      /* 3) If we're running in Photoshop */
      if (app.name === "Adobe Photoshop") {
        /* 4) Adjust the color balance of the art layer */
        layer.adjustColorBalance([0,0,0], [-10,0,0], [-50,0,0]);
      }
      /* 5) If it's InDesign */
      else if (app.name === "Adobe InDesign") {
        /* 6) Use the currentWeatherString as the text frame contents */
        frame.contents = currentWeatherString;
      }
      break;

    /* 7) Repeat for clear night... */
    case "clear-night":
      if (app.name === "Adobe Photoshop") {
        layer.adjustColorBalance([0,0,33], [-39,-14,100], [-10,0,17]);
      }
      else if (app.name === "Adobe InDesign") {
        frame.contents = currentWeatherString;
      }
      break;

    /* 8) And so on for all possible currentWeatherSlug strings... */
    }
}
```

When you run the extension, the output will look like this:

![](ps)
![](id)

In other words, if the panel is running in Photoshop, we'll adjust the color balance of an art layer; if the panel is running in InDesign, we'll add a string that tells us the weather to the document.
